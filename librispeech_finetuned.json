It is our primary sense and it is how we take in and understand the vast majority of the information in our environment.\nThe idea is that by closing our eyes, we stop relying on the visual input and open our ears to hear the sounds and then we imagine based on the sound alone, you can think of it like a visual blindfold test.\nSo the text above is actually an excerpt of a longer text which is being transcribed, it’s about a scene that’s being imagined by the author based on the sound only"
